ABOUT GEOSPATIAL HIERARCHY
The unique key that will allow us to join tables is the GEOID - geographic identifier. These are numerical
codes used by the Census Burea to uniquely identify geographic areas like states, counties, and most 
importantly, census tracts. 

For example, the 11-character tract GEOID is a recommended identifier that combines the 
state and county FIPS codes with a tract code (SSCCCTTTTTT). You can find these IDs on the Census 
Bureau's website. Rhode Island's state code is 44. However, you can filter even more granularly 
than this using county codes. For instance, the county code for Providence is 007, so the GEOID for 
data in Providence will always take the form '44007XXXXXX'. This is important info to take into 
account when querying information, as we need to filter by Rhode Island level results and lower.
